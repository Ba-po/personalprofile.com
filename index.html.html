	<p>He, who wears the same name as yours, is now a grown man of his words, a man with integrity. The integrity that he carries has made him become more proper and attached to the human nature values. If you'll be able to meet each other, he's now able to teach you the wonders of the world of programming and the patterns of cube. One day, you will see an image that is more than what you're staring at right now. This man will soon have a spot on his desired company, he will have his name carved on the plate on his desk.</p>
